<p align="justify">
I'm a Data scientist working at <a href="https://www.apporchid.com">AppOrchid Inc</a>'s R&D Division. My current work is skewed towards Document Representation learning and Semantic PDF understanding for financial doc cohorts where I extract metadata from legalese docs using DL & traditional vision techniques. I’m broadly interested across representation learning problems in CV, resource constrained-ML, and statistical hypothesis analysis for handling long-tails in OOD inference.

Prior to this, I was an OSS contributor and mentor at <a href="https://www.openmined.org">OpenMined</a>, exploring my research interests in PPML **∩** Differential privacy. I also spent a year at <a href="https://www.solitontech.com">Soliton tech</a> designing end-to-end real time stereo image processing pipelines for industrial systems.
<br>
<br>

I graduated from <a href="https://www.annauniv.edu">Anna University</a> in India with a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering. My research interests at that time were in the interdisciplinary field of electrical machine design optimization using statistical analysis, and I still relish contemporary research there.
