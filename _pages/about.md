<p align="justify">
I'm a Data scientist working at <a href="https://www.apporchid.com">AppOrchid Inc</a>'s R&D Division. My current work is skewed towards Document Representation learning and Semantic PDF understanding for financial doc cohorts where I extract document metadata from legalese docs using DL & traditional vision techniques. I’m broadly interested across representation learning problems in CV, resource constrained-ML, and statistical hypothesis analysis for handling long-tails in OOD inference.

Prior to this, I was part of the vibrant community at <a href="https://www.openmined.org">OpenMined</a> exploring my intersectional interest in PPML and Differential privacy-FL techniques. I also spent a year at <a href="https://www.solitontech.com">Soliton tech</a> designing end-end to real time stereo image processing pipelines for industrial systems.

<br>

I graduated from <a href="https://www.annauniv.edu">Anna University</a> in India with a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering. My research interests then, were in the interdisciplinary field of electrical machine design optimization using statistical tools and ML and I still relish contemporary research here.

This site was recently made and is a little sparse. You can find a summary of my past work <a href="https://krishnansr.github.io/cv">here</a>.
