<p align="justify">
I'm a graduate student studying Computer Vision and Machine Learning at the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu">Robotics Institute</a>, Carnegie Mellon University.  Last summer, I interned with the Perception team at <a href="https://www.waymo.com">Waymo</a>, working on large Vision Language Models (VLMs) to solve the long tail edge scenarios. I'm broadly interested in problems at the heart of visual perception, image synthesis, multi-modal learning, robotics, and all things machine intelligence. I have past experience in building real-time scalable data systems to address some of these challenges.

  At <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">CMU</a>, I am working with the Air Lab in the Robotics Institute, on multi-view stereo Depth prediction from 6-pair fisheye camera lenses for autonomous navigation. Earlier, I worked with the Xu Lab in the School of Computer Science as a research assistant, exploring visual learning pipelines for self-supervised extraction of 3D object-aware representations using controllable GANs and domain adaptation. I also TA'ed the popular Machine learning course from the ML Department over the Spring (392 students) and Fall (487 students) semesters in 2023.

  Prior to grad school, I led the India data science team at <a href="https://www.apporchid.com">AppOrchid Inc's</a> R&D Division. My research problems here were skewed towards Document Representation learning and Semantic PDF understanding for financial doc cohorts where I extract metadata from legalese docs using DL & traditional vision techniques. My work spanned across representation learning problems in CV, resource constrained-ML, and statistical hypothesis analysis for handling long-tails in OOD inference.

  I was an OSS contributor and technical mentor at <a href="https://www.openmined.org">OpenMined</a>, exploring my research interests in PPML <strong>∩</strong> Differential privacy. I also spent a year at <a href="https://www.solitontech.com">Soliton tech</a> designing end-to-end real time stereo image processing pipelines to control $2MM pilot industrial systems. I graduated from <a href="https://www.annauniv.edu">Anna University</a>, India with a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering. My past research interests were in the interdisciplinary field of electrical motor design optimization using statistical analysis tools, and I still relish contemporary research here.
